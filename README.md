## Description

This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures and how to analyze problems and design algorithms.

We will use JAVA as a vehicle, in an object based manner (**not OOP**)  i.e.  mainly encapsulation and abstraction. The rationale is that you will be able to transfer your knowledge to any other language with ease. At the end of the course, we will cover Java Collections Framework.

Throughout the course, you will be encouraged to think critically and apply your knowledge to real-world problems. Also you will have hands-on experience on how algorithms and data structures concepts are implemented.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures, including analyzing problems, designing algorithms, and implementing data structures.
- Evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and data structures and select appropriate techniques for solving problems.
- Apply your knowledge of algorithms and data structures to real-world problems and effectively communicate solutions to others.
- Understand the role of algorithms and data structures in a variety of fields and how they can be used to solve complex problems in different domains.
- Work collaboratively with peers to solve problems and complete programming assignments.

Overall, by achieving these learning outcomes,  you will gain a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures that will enable you to succeed in a variety of fields.

## Course Mechanics

This course is worth 5 ECTS which maps to 135 hours: (1 ECTS = 27 hours ).

- The workload is divided into mini-lectures, homework, group activities and pair programming tasks.
- In addition to the lectures, you should plan to spend some time each week studying beyond class.
